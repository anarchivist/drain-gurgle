His company, dick clark productions (sold in 2007), has produced shows, specials and movies ranging from classic to contemporary, such as American Bandstand (1952-1989) and the popular So You Think You Can Dance.  Clark was perhaps best known for his annual appearance as host of Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve, broadcast live from Times Square in New York every December 31 since 1972. Although a stroke in 2004 prevented him from hosting that year, he returned in 2005 and continued to host the show (with Ryan Seacrest) until his death in 2012. Clark received numerous awards and recognitions for his contributions to the profession, including four Emmys and a Peabody; induction into the National Radio Hall of Fame, the Broadcasting Magazine Hall of Fame and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame; and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame."

He has been called America's \"poet laureate of radio.\" On May 8, 1945, his one-hour live broadcast on the occasion of the end of World War II, On A Note of Triumph, drew 60 million listeners; poet Carl Sandburg praised it as \"one of the all-time great American poems.\"  Corwin is also the author of several books, including Holes In A Stained Glass Window (1978) and Trivializing America (1983), and his script for the movie Lust For Life (1957) was nominated for an Oscar. His television credits include his 1971 series \"Norman Corwin Presents.\" In the 1990s he began a new series of radio program for National Public Radio, whose casts have included William Shatner, Jack Lemmon, Charles Kuralt, Martin Landau, Hume Cronyn, and Charles Durning. Corwin was recognized many times over his career for his achievements; his awards include a Peabody (1941, the first year they were awarded), the One World Award (1946), a duPont-Columbia Award, and an Honorary Doctorate from Lincoln College (1990). He was inducted into the Radio Hall of Fame in 1993, and in 2006 a documentary \"Film\" on his life (A Note of Triumph: The Golden Age of Norman Corwin) won an Academy Award for Best Documentary (Short Feature)."

      "These tapes of WAER broadcasts primarily hold topical broadcasts and live concert recordings. Few of the tapes are dated, but those that are cover a span from 1965 to 1979. Announcers or presenters are rarely identified. The news items include a mix of national and local productions, but there are relatively few in the collection compared to the concert recordings. Many concerts were given by popular artists such as Pink Floyd, Bonnie Raitt, Canned Heat, Niels Lofgren, and Commander Cody, taken from national broadcasts, mostly originating from New York City or Boston. The collection contains recordings of only a handful of concerts broadcast by Syracuse University student ensembles. 25 tapes are identified as having been recorded on-campus at the Jabberwocky Café; surviving performances from this intimate venue include those given by John Fahey, Taj Mahal, and David Bromberg."

      "The Institute of Public Affairs at the University of Virginia was founded in 1927 by University President Edwin A. Alderman and Professor Charles G. Maphis. Prof. Maphis served as director of the Institute until his death in 1938. Successive directors were Professors Robert K. Gooch (1938), Hardy C. Dillard (1939-1941), Oron J. Hale (1942), and George B. Zehmer (1950-1953). The meetings of the Institute were organized with the cooperation and participation of President Alderman and his first two successors as University President, John L. Newcomb and Colgate W. Darden. According to its Statement of Purpose, \"The Institute of Public Affairs [was] designed to advance the popular understanding of current public questions. [It] propose[d] to emphasize particularly the domestic problems of the United States and to have them discussed in a broad and competent fashion by men charged with the task of public administration and by those who are actively engaged in public affairs.\" The Institute of Public Affairs was modeled on the Institute of Politics at Williams College in Williamstown, Massachusetts, which dealt primarily with international issues. To avoid conflict, the Institute of Public Affairs confined itself to local, state, regional, and national issues until after the Institute of Politics was discontinued, whereupon the Institute began to employ discussions of foreign affairs. The Institute initially convened each summer for two weeks, usually between the months of June and July. Later, the length of the program was shortened to one week. The Institute met annually from 1927 until 1942, when it was temporarily discontinued due to the exigencies of the war. It was reconvened in 1950, and continued to meet annually until it was discontinued after the twentieth meeting in 1953."

Interviews with elites and homeless, artists and activists, and most important of all perhaps, the voice of the listener-callers, who helped define the tone of the program. While too modern to fit into the parameters of this project, I think it’s value to historians and political scientists and cultural studies scholars presents an argument for its inclusion and for rethinking the narrow time frame of this project."

Not the least of which is the archive at the University of Maryland, the National Archives, the Radio and TV Broadcast Museum in NYC, and another series of archives in Los Angeles.     So what activities should be undertaken to improve preservation of past radio broadcasts? I think foremost would be tapping the radio-aircheck collector network, which is huge. Here I am talking about the home tapers and not so much the \"Old-time Radio Clubs\" as the Old-Time-Radio folks tend to trade in well documented material (but as individuals they may also have unique, undocumented material). The folks who trade in 1950s and more recent material have hundreds of thousands of hours of live on air recordings which do not exist in any public or private archived holding."

      "The core of our collection is tape transfers of 509 radio transcription discs. The originals were part of the Sound Archive until 1994, when they left with our former sound archivist. The copies are preservation reel-to-reel tapes and reference cassettes. The recordings date from the mid 1930s through the mid 1950s, and document programs originally aired on WEVD, WCNW, WOR, WNYC, WHN, WBBC, WCBS and WMCA. These include news, variety, human interest and radio dramas, primarily in Yiddish and English. We also have some copies of The Eternal Light radio programs from the 1940s on acetate-on-glass discs.  Additionally, there is a collection of off-air cassettes of WEVD radio programs from the 1970s-90s made by an avid listener, as well as radio programs sponsored by YIVO and by the Workmen's Circle. We also have Yiddish radio programs recorded in Israel (uncatalogued)."

It was an \"underground\" radio program broadcast on a clear-channel station from Little Rock.

He talks about the influence of Berg and Stravinsky in his composition, but though he uses aspects of their methods in his own composing, he never adoptes them fully. He speaks about the meaning of avant-garde and new classical music in past and today, and compares it to \"conservative music.\" He discusses the opera Lulu by Alban Berg. The composer introduces each of the following works, which are then played in their entierty: String quartert no. 5, Solo partita (for violin and viola), Serenade no. 1 (for solo viola and chamber orchestra)."

He talks about the influence of Berg and Stravinsky in his composition, but though he uses aspects of their methods in his own composing, he never adoptes them fully. He speaks about the meaning of avant-garde and new classical music in past and today, and compares it to \"conservative music.\" He discusses the opera Lulu by Alban Berg. The composer introduces each of the following works, which are then played in their entierty: String quartert no. 5, Solo partita (for violin and viola), Serenade no. 1 (for solo viola and chamber orchestra)."

He discusses various of his works such as two operas: Summer and smoke, and Natalia Petrovna; and the music he composed for two balets: After Eden (choreography by John Butler) and Suite for orchestra for Hearts, meadows, and flags (choreography by Richard Wagner). Excepts of two ballets are played during the interview."

The composer speaks about music by Arnold Schoenberg that influenced him, and he has composed a large quantity of music which is stylistically tied to the works of Schoenberg. He talks about his opera Lily (based on Saul Bellow's Henderson, the Rain King). The composer also discusses each of the following works, excerpts of which are then played during the interview: Music for orchestra (1970), Sonata concertante (for violin and piano, first movement) (1952), Quartet no. 3 (for strings and electronic tape)."

L. van Beethoven's Große fugue from his String quartet, no. 13 (3:55, fades out) to counteract Pleasants' thesis that \"Serious music is a dead art.\""

During intermission on Reel 1, Berger conducts a taped interview of the members of the string quartet, who share their personal experiences of performing with Primavera, and talk about Tchaikovsky's Third string quartet, a memorial dedicated to his friendship of Ferdinand Laub. The interview resumed on Reel 2, followed by the rest of the concert. Five songs for string quartet are arranged from these George Gershwin songs: 1. \"He loves, [and] she loves,\" 2. \"Fascinating rhythm,\" 3. \"Do it again,\" \"Clap yo' hands,\" and 5. \"Sweet and low down.\" A surprise encore of an unidentified Kurt Weill arrangement is also performed."

He discusses the twelve-note technique that he created (not the same as twelve-tone system, used in conjunction with the music of Schoenberg and other twelve-tone composers). The composer also discusses each of the following works, excerpts of which are then played during the interview: Armenian suite, Desolate city, Violin concerto (1949), Piano concerto (second and third movements) (1957), and two excerpts from the mass Come Creator Spirit: Holy, Holy, Holy (Sanctus) and Lamb of God (Agnus Dei) (dedicated to the 125th anniversary of Fordham University) (1966)."

Notable programs represented in the collection include adaptations of the plays of Henrik Ibsen and Oscar Wilde, operettas by Gilbert & Sullivan, a series called A CAPELLA IN BRONZE featuring the WPA Negro Radio Chorus and focusing on stories of particular interest to African-Americans, adaptations of books such as Dickens' PICKWICK PAPERS and plays such as Tolstoy's REDEMPTION, Goldsmith's SHE STOOPS TO CONQUER and Molière's TARTUFFE. A 1939 series celebrating Jazz entitled THE STORY OF SWING devoted episodes to Duke Ellington, Benny Goodman, and the Dorsey Brothers. TURNING POINTS IN FAMOUS LIVES dramatized key moments in the lives of John Paul Jones, Sarah Bernhardt, Louis Pasteur, Isaac Newton, Billy the Kid, Joseph Stalin, and others. THE LIVING NEWSPAPER, adapted from a concurrent Federal Theatre Project stage series, dramatized contemporary problems facing listeners in daily life."

In its four years of existence the F.T.P. employed some 12,700 theater professionals in 31 states, and presented more than 1,000 performances each month, free of charge. In addition to its stage production units, the F.T.P. reached an estimated 10 million listeners with its FEDERAL THEATRE OF THE AIR radio programs, broadcast over all the major networks. In 1939 Congress abolished the Federal Theatre Program."

      "Charlotte Shedd was born in Austria in 1913 as Charlotte Kraus, and became a student of the performing arts. In 1938, she was denied the right to appear on stage because of the Nazi occupation of Austria, the Nuremberg Laws, and her father's Jewish background. On Christmas Eve 1938, she escaped to America with a nearly expired Austrian passport and began her singing career. Shortly thereafter, she met Eleanor Roosevelt's bodyguard, who introduced her to the First Lady, beginning a close friendship that lasted until Mrs. Roosevelt's death in 1962."

      "Ishmael Reed, African-American novelist, poet, and publisher, was born in Chattanooga, Tennessee, on February 22, 1938. Reed moved with his mother to Buffalo, New York in 1942. His mother worked in various wartime industries and Reed attended public schools, graduating in 1956. He also played violin and trombone and began writing a newspaper column on jazz for the Empire Star Weekly when he was thirteen. He enrolled as an evening student at Millard Fillmore College, the night school division of the University of Buffalo, and worked as a clerk at the Buffalo public library during the day. His writing ability was quickly recognized, and he moved into the bachelor of arts program at the University of Buffalo. He withdrew in 1960 because of a \"dire shortage of funds\" (Gates) and a \"wide gap between social classes\" (Gates). To escape \"the artificial social and class distinctions that he associated with American university education,\" (Gates) he moved to Buffalo's Talbert Mall Project. Daily exposure to systematic poverty cycles in the projects led him to political activism in the civil rights and Black Power movements."

The collection consists of nearly 150 linear feet of papers and also includes scrapbooks, books, photographs, and film and sound recordings. For the most part, the arrangement of the collection reflects the original filing series of Senator Williams's office. The collection is divided into 25 series which are organized under four record subgroups. The first three subgroups--Legislative Staff/Office Files, Constituent Correspondence and Cases, and Administrative and Personal Office Files--consist of series that document the work performed in office by Senator Williams and his staff. The subgroups reflect the functions of the Senator's work and include series typical of a congressional collection. Duties reflected in the Legislative Staff/Office Files include committee, legislative, and investigative work. The Constituent Correspondence and Cases subgroup includes materials created in response to the concerns and interests of constituents, and those filed on receipt of issue-related opinions from the general public. The Administrative and Personal Office Files reflect the management of the office and the Senator's personal schedule. The fourth subgroup, Personal, includes series of files and other formats that document the personal activities and opinions of Senator Williams. The material in these files supplements information about his Senate career in the first three subgroups. There is also material from the 1970s and about Mrs. Williams and Senator Williams's family life. "

      "Papers of Dore Schary, a playwright, motion picture executive, and activist in Jewish and liberal political causes documenting both his personal and professional life. Included are general correspondence; microfilmed scrapbooks; scripts and production material for plays and motion pictures; records pertaining to MGM; non-dramatic writings, speeches (many in recorded form), and an autobiography and a family memoir; home movies and photographs; correspondence, reports, lists, financial records, and speeches from his tenure as national chairman of the Anti-Defamation League and subject files on other organizations with which he was involved such as the American Civil Liberties Union, the American Jewish Committee, and the Democratic Party; and personal and biographical information. Documentation in the production files varies but may include correspondence, notes, variant drafts of scripts, clippings, financial records, publicity, stills, designs, and casting information. Records of Schary's years as executive producer, studio head, and vice-president at MGM include reports of executive meetings, correspondence and memoranda, and scattered financial reports. Also present are papers pertaining to the career of Schary's wife Miriam, painter M. Svet. The collection is arranged in four parts: the Original Collection, the 1968 Additions, the 1977 Additions, and the 1981 Additions. The Original Collection dates 1923-1962 and is organized in these categories: Biographical and Personal Material, General Files, General Writings, and Production Files. The 1968 Additions date 1933-1952 and consist of Production Files only. The 1977 Additions date circa 1920-1980 (though primarily 1956-1977) and again contain Biographical and Personal Material, General Files, General Writings, and Production Files, as well as a new category, Anti-Defamation League Files. Finally, the 1981 Additions date 1924-1980 (primarily 1974-1980) and include the same categories as the 1977 Additions plus a separate category for Disc Recordings. The Original Collection includes other disc recordings, and tape recordings are present in all but the 1968 additions. Some records are present only in microfilm format."

      "The Armed Forces Radio Service (AFRS) was established by the War Department on May 26, 1942 to entertain, inform and connect troops to back home. The broadcast were also intended to counter propaganda broadcasts by Tokyo Rose, Axis Sally and other radio personalities supported by the Axis alliance. The AFRS network was launched with a five hour broadcast on July 4, 1943. The network quickly grew and by the end of World War II included 300 stations, broadcasting to troops around the world. Programs were distributed to stations on 16\" polyvinyl discs that contained fifteen minutes of information. Bing Crosby, Bob Hope, Dinah Shore, Frank Sinatra and other major stars of the day performed on the network free of charge as their contribution to the war effort. Radio networks and record labels provided free access their programming and recordings to help develop programming for the network. In addition to bringing the troops programming from networks and the record labels, the service also created original programs like Jubilee which featured African American bands and entertainers. The AFRS network continued broadcasting through Korea, Vietnam and other subsequent wars and conflicts. Now known as the Armed Forces Network, the service continues to entertain servicemen and servicewomen stationed around the world."

In its early years, the Society was a loose organization which brought its members together for socializing and informal exchanges over dinner and on the golf links. While the activities of the Societyhave become more structured and sophisticated as the industryhas matured, the social aspect is still a prominent feature of its annual meetings and expositions."

This approach typified much of the private residential and commercial construction of the period and stood in contrast to the austere modernism of contemporary architects. Pahlmann also played a major role in organizing and elevating the status of interior design as a profession."

      "Jack \"The Rapper\" Gibson was a pioneer in Black radio, as well as an innovator, a leader, and a mentor to many in the radio and music industries. His work as a Black radio deejay spanned the early days of Black radio in the 1940s through the Civil Rights Movement, and included stints at WERD-Atlanta, WLOU-Louisville, WMBM-Miami, WCIN-Cincinnati, and WABQ-Cleveland. After retiring from radio in 1961, he became a successful music industry executive working for Motown, Decca, and Stax Records. In 1976, he launched the industry magazine Jack the Rapper, the oldest Black trade publication targeted to radio, and for the next twenty years organized the annual \"Jack the Rapper’s Family Affair,\" a Black music convention drawing generations of performers and music industry executives. His professionalism, continuous fight for racial equality and justice, and endearing human qualities made him a legend in the industry. This collection documents his long career in radio and music through personal correspondence, clippings, memorabilia, photographs, publicity materials, airchecks, interviews, lecture materials, and over 500 issues of his trade magazine \"Jack the Rapper's Mellow Yellow.\""

In the early 1930s his company, the Southern Television and Broadcasting Ccompany, Inc., operated television stations W5XA and W5CBU from the top of Gidden's Castle about 14 miles east of Shreveport on the Minden Road. Because of lack of financial backing, however, all the equipment was sold in 1934."

Broadcasting was his passion and as a young boy in the Midwest, he'd listen to W.K. Henderson's \"Hello World! Doggone Ya!\" broadcast from the 50,000 watt KWKH radio station in Shreveport, Louisiana. When he returned from the war, he moved south in 1946 to join KWKH as a sports announcer. In 1953, he served as project manager who obtained the television license for KSLA TV, the first in the area. He worked at KSLA for eleven years, then moved to KTBS as station manager. Flett worked in the broadcasting business for thirty-five years, twenty-two of those in television in Shreveport. He died June 23, 2009."

The collection forms part of the Woodberry Poetry Room. While it does not contain a complete inventory of his work, the collection features substantial numbers of discs from all stages of the recording and production process, and constitutes the single-largest aggregate of his recordings of spoken literature. In addition to the discs he created for publication, the materials include rare outtakes; original recordings never reproduced or intended for commercial release; Harvard-related language lessons, lectures, sermons, theatrical, radio, and musical performances; and the voices of Harvard students and professors recorded in his role as Professor of Public Speaking. The collection also features listening copies that Packard (and Woodberry Poetry Room curator John Lincoln Sweeney) created based on exchanges he arranged with the Library of Congress, the British Broadcasting Corporation, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, and Radio Éireann."

      "Frederick C. Packard, Jr. (1899-1985), H '20, served as Professor of Public Speaking in the Department of English at Harvard University and as Director of the Speech Clinic, in conjunction with the Department of Hygiene. As early as 1928-1929, Packard began to clamor for the creation of a library of voices. With the help of his colleague E. K. Rand, he coined the term \"vocarium\" to describe his vision for a place where \"voices can be kept and studied.\" In 1933, his efforts led to the publication by Harvard University Phonograph Records of the first discs in what came to be called the Harvard Vocarium, one of the first poetry/literature recordings labels in the world. One of the authors featured in this preliminary commercial release was Harvard graduate T. S. Eliot, who recorded for Packard during his Charles Eliot Norton lectureship in 1932-33. The recording represents Eliot's first published poetry reading. From 1940, until the university discontinued its affiliation in 1955, the Harvard Vocarium made and, in many cases commercially released, the first (or earliest extant) recordings by Elizabeth Bishop, Randall Jarrell, Robinson Jeffers, Weldon Kees, Robert Lowell, Archibald MacLeish, Marianne Moore, Vladimir Nabokov, Anais Nin, Ezra Pound, Muriel Rukeyser, May Sarton, Robert Penn Warren, and Tennessee Williams. In addition to his commercial venture, Packard actively recorded, commissioned, collected, and created \"a repository of all the voices he could get a hold of, a kind of audio time capsule for posterity,\" according to Vocarium discographer Josephine Packard. These recordings ranged from surgeries to Shakespeare, Haitian-Creole ritual performances to Japanese-language lessons, experimental radio plays to Scottish border-ballads. The breadth of languages he recorded in is equally remarkable—among them, Afrikaans, Catalan, Haitian Creole, Chinese, Danish, French, German, Russian, Sanskrit, Spanish, and Yiddish. Packard found a practical depository and an organically evolving home for his \"vocarium\" in the recently opened Woodberry Poetry Room (then on the top floor of Widener Library), where master recordings were held and two phonograph players were subsequently installed for student use. As Packard later recalled: \"My Vocarium was in there.\" A 1938 Boston Sunday Post article hailed his efforts, announcing that \"Harvard University, one of the most forward universities in the world, is breaking all precedent and founding a library for the voice—the Harvard Vocarium.\" With the Poetry Room’s move to the new Lamont Library in 1949, the \"library service\" (as Packard referred to it) was formalized, and custom-designed consoles were created to facilitate listening by 36 students at a time. During the first four months of the collection’s relocation to Lamont Library, \"students signed for earphones in the Poetry Room over 4,000 times.\" In the course of his 45-year career at Harvard University, Packard taught courses in rhetoric, oratory, \"the oral interpretation of literature,\" radio-broadcasting, and (in his final post at the Harvard Divinity School) the art of sermonizing. His innovative work at the Speech Clinic transformed the lives of students and faculty who sought his assistance for stuttering and other speech impediments. Packard’s recordings were made in a number of venues and makeshift studios across campus, including Holden Chapel, Memorial Hall, the Cruft Memorial Laboratory, the Lamont Forum Room, and the Germanic Museum. Packard retired from Harvard in 1965. He died in Brunswick, Maine, on June 26, 1985. In 2002, the Harvard Vocarium was chosen as a part of the first annual selection of the National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress."

Until its closing in early 2014, it was particularly involved with placing top policy analysts, social innovators, and on-the-ground organizers on radio and television stations across the country and globe. One such project, A World of Possibilities radio show, founded in 2001, was an award-winning one hour weekly show hosted by Sommer. A program \"of spirited global conversations,\" featuring interviews searching for understanding of, and solutions to, longstanding global public affairs challenges, A World of Possibilities was nationally and internationally syndicated until it ceased broadcasting in 2011. The MMP Records contain over ten linear feet of CD and DVD masters of uncut interviews and produced radio shows. Shows, including Heart of the Matter and A World of Possibilities, explore promising new thinking and experimentation in fields ranging from energy, food, water, and wilderness to human rights, global security, and public health, and include interviews with leading experts and innovators, such as Studs Terkel, Pete Seeger, Laurie Garrett, Wangari Maathai, Frances Moore Lappe, Howard Gardner, Lily Yeh, Robert Reich, Majora Carter, Van Jones and many more. The collection also contains MMP business files, consisting of correspondence, reports, articles, grant information, and organizational materials."

Emphasizing sustainability and greater local food sufficiency, he has been instrumental in developing organic standards for gardening and land care and he has served as both founding president and later executive director of the Northeast Organic Farming Association Connecticut and president of the NOFA Interstate Council. During the 1990s, Duesing produced two radio shows, \"Living on the Earth\" (WSHU) and \"The Politics of Food\" (WPKN), and he is author of (1993). The Duesing collection consists of transcripts of his radio show, \"Living on the Earth\" (1990-2000) and fourteen recordings of \"The Politics of Food,\" which was broadcast monthly over WPKN (89.5 FM) in Bridgeport in 1997-1998. Each half hour segment of \"Politics\" included news, a fifteen minute interview, recipes, and tips, with interviewees including Mel Bristol, Jac Smit, Vincent Kay, John Wargo, Hugh Joseph, Joseph Kiefer, Julie Rawson, Michael Sligh, Kathy Lawrence, Lee Warren, and Elizabeth Henderson."

      "A professor of English at UMass Amherst, James A. Freeman is a scholar of seventeenth century British literature who has compiled an impressively eclectic array of publications and research projects. Educated at Amherst College (AB 1956) and the University of Minnesota (PhD 1968), Freeman joined the faculty in the English Department at UMass shortly after completing his doctorate. He has published on topics ranging from Latin and Greek poets to Shakespeare, Milton, Swift, Tennyson, James Agee, Donald Duck, 17th century regicides, and 1930s radio. He has also served as a regular contributor and editor for the Association for Gravestone Studies Quarterly. The Freeman collection consists of many hundreds of cassette tapes of radio broadcasts from the 1930s through early 1950s, reflecting the culture of commercial radio during its golden age. The collection includes representatives of most of the major genres, including comedy, drama, suspense and mystery, soap operas, and westerns. There is some depth popular programs such as Amos and Andy, the Great Gildersleeve, Philip Marlowe, and Nero Wolfe, but the collection also includes less common and short-lived shows."

Many of its early members were also affiliated with the student radio station WMUA, and throughout the 1970s, the organization played a prominent role in providing programming to the station, offering programming highlighting African American music and current affairs. The BCMP collection consists of many dozens of reel to reel audiotapes of radio broadcasts aired over WMUA during the 1970s and early 1980s by and for the university’s African American community. Included is a range of locally-produced public affairs, cultural, and music programming, with some content licensed from around the country. A few of the tapes are associated with the Five College’s National Public Radio affiliate, WFCR."

Although the most productive portion of his career was brief, he exerted a strong influence on the field of set design and lighting, and was fairly prolific as a writer on theatre. The six audio recordings that comprise the Craig collection originated from a series of BBC radio talks in the early 1950s. The reel to reel tapes include Craig’s reminiscences of Ellen Terry, Isadora Duncan, the old school of acting, celebrities, and how he played Hamlet in Salford, Lancashire."

      "The Milo Ryan / CBS Radio News Phonoarchive is a unique audio time capsule that documents many historic 20th century events. It consists of sound recordings of CBS Radio News programs, public affairs shows, actualities, speeches, interviews, wartime dramas, daily World War II news updates. The recordings capture groundbreaking broadcasts by Edward R. Murrow and his \"Boys\": William L. Shirer, Eric Sevareid, Tom Grandin, Larry LeSueur, Charles Collingwood, Howard K. Smith, Winston Burdett, Bill Downs, Mary Marvin Breckinridge, Cecil Brown, and Richard C. Hottelet. The collection also includes recordings of programs and speeches made by public figures during and beyond WW II, including Churchill, Eisenhower, Einstein, Hitler, and JFK. As Dr. Donald Godfrey writes in his 1973 article \"History Held a Microphone\": \"There are twenty-two hundred and twenty-seven newscasts. All but a handful originating from CBS. Their newscasts represent every weekday without a miss, from September 7, 1939, with the Germans entering Poland, to April 2, 1945, with the allies entering Germany.... Tapes contain examples of special events coverage: the Japanese attack of Pearl Harbor, the bombing of Japan, landings in North Africa, the 13 Normandy Invasion, the World Security Conference, April, 1945, the function of the American and Russian Armies, April, 1945, the death and funeral of FDR, and miles of tape on V. E. and V.J. days. Elmer Davis' daily five minute reports are represented in entirety from his debut, September 16, 1939, to February 13, 1941, and occasionally to July 9, 1943. H. V. Kaltenbom edits the news, complete from August 27, 1939, until January 26, 1940, and sporadically thereafter. Our library includes 21 speeches by Winston Churchill, representing 12 hours of this master of language. There are 51 talks by President Roosevelt totaling 24 continuous hours.\" A detailed description of most of the recordings in the Phonoarchive is available in Milo Ryan's book History in Sound (UW Press)."

Large collection of audio masters on reel-to-reel polyester tape of radionovela (radio soap opera) programs produced by the America's Production Inc. in Miami, Florida during the late 1960s. The company was created by Louis J. Boeri who saw an opportunity to fill the void in Spanish-language radio programming after the collapse of the industry in post-revolutionary Cuba. The programs were produced, written, and performed by a group consisting primarily of professionals, writers, technicians, and performing artists who left Cuba during or just after the 1959 Revolution and Mexican writers as well. In addition to the tapes, there is a small amount of marketing print material that describes the production process and provides program catalogs with synopses of many of the radionovelas produced by API that were licensed to radio stations across Latin America, the United States, and Europe. A small selection of titles and episodes have been dubbed onto compact discs and are available for consultation. There is also a small amount of video and film related to the production of a telenovela (television soap opera)."

      "The son of Ocie Dell and Rev. William Albert Crim, Mort Crim was born on July 31st, 1935 in West Frankfort, Illinois. Growing up in the Church of God, he originally went into the field of ministry but later decided on a career in journalism and broadcasting. Since then, he has made a conscious decision to utilize his position to share good news rather than sensationalist reporting. Crim attended Anderson College before ultimately receiving his undergraduate degree from the University of Nebraska at Omaha. He went on to attain a Master’s degree from Northwestern University’s Medill School of Journalism. He was later inducted into the Medill Hall of Achievement and has received five honorary doctorates. In popular culture today, Crim is widely known as the inspiration for Will Ferrell’s Anchorman. In 1958, he joined the Air Force, where he served as a reporter for four years. His first widely known broadcasting work was in New York at the time of the 1965 blackouts. He then continued reporting as a national ABC correspondent in New York, where he covered the historic moon landing and Lyndon B. Johnson’s tour to Australia, Vietnam, and Korea. He moved to WHAS News in Louisville, Kentucky in 1969 before beginning his own essay-style broadcast, One Moment Please, in the 1970s. Mort Crim received an honorary Doctor of Letters degree from Anderson College in 1974. He served on the Board of Trustees at Anderson College/University from 1974 to 1989. He continued his reporting work for News 4 Detroit as Senior Editor and Anchor from 1978 to 1997. From 1980-1984, he was also a permanent vacation substitute for Paul Harvey. He hosted the PBS program New Tech Times in 1984. During his years at WDIV-TV in Detroit, he began writing and recording the program for which he is perhaps most famous, Second Thoughts, a nationally syndicated series of ninety-second, motivational essays which ran from 1991 to 2006. His other radio programs include Mort Crim News You’ll Talk About and Mort Crim Stories from the USA.  In addition to a radio personality and news anchorman, Crim is an active volunteer, public speaker, licensed pilot, and CEO of Mort Crim Communications, Inc. He has been awarded several Emmys for documentaries and news reporting in 1971, 1978, 1979, 1981, 1989, and 1991. Crim also won the 1995 Gold World Medal as Best Radio Personality at the New York Festivals’ International Radio Awards and the 2010 Lifetime Achievement Award from the University of Nebraska. In 2010, he was inducted into the Broadcast Pioneers of Philadelphia's Hall of Fame. Crim is also the author of seven books. Crim retired from anchoring in 1997 and radio broadcasting in 2006. He is married to Alice \"Irene\" Bowman Miller, also an alumnus of Anderson University."

In addition to the stories, some participants sent cassette tapes or \"CD\"s of themselves reading their stories or performing music to accompany the submission. Also included are books, photographs, newspapers, magazines, pamphlets and other materials either meant to verify their submission as true, add context to their submission, or to show other formats that their submissions had appeared in previously."

      "The National Story project began in 1999 after American author, Paul Auster, read a selection from his novel Timbuktu on NPR's Weekend All Things Considered. Auster was asked to return to the program by its then host, Daniel Zwerdling, to perform another reading at a future date. Auster answered with the conditional response that he would be willing to return, but only if he could read other people's stories and not just his own.  The National Story Project began taking submissions from listeners in 1999 October through both e-mail and mail. The guidelines for the stories were that they had to be no more than three pages in length and that the submissions relayed a true event. The selected stories would then be edited or rewritten, if needed, by Auster and his team. The National Story Project aired on Weekend All Things Considered the first Saturday of each month from 1999 November until 2001 July and during that time received over 5,000 submissions from all over the United States on a wide variety of topics and from people of varying ages, gender and backgrounds."

With its many breakthrough practices, from being the first radio station to use a slogan to broadcasting a Spanish translation of \"Voice of America\" programs to Cuba during the Cuban Missile Crisis, WSB always remained cutting edge and more importantly, relevant.

      "Jazz City was a weekly program produced by jazz expert Dr. Robert Snyder of the University of Wisconsin Oshkosh faculty and which aired over campus station WRST-FM in Oshkosh, Wisconsin from 1966-2008. Starting in the late 1970s, dubs (on reel) of the program were offered for free to other non-commercial/public radio stations, including WDCB/Glen Ellyn, IL, WSSU/Superior, WI, WUWM/Milwaukee, WI; WGBW/Green Bay, WI; KICB/Fort Dodge, IA; WXPR/Rhinelander, WI; KSMU/Springfield, MO and possibly WHIL/Mobile, AL. It also aired briefly on commercial station KIFZ-AM/Fond du Lac, WI. The one hour program often had a theme, while others sampled new releases and to add context, Snyder would share what then-new releases were reviewed ten years' prior in Downbeat magazine. Program engineering was always the duty of a student in Radio TV Film at UW Oshkosh, where Snyder was the founder of the major and its academic coordinator. NOTE: After his death in 2008, Snyder's jazz collection of recordings, magazines and other material was willed to the UW Oshkosh music department which holds it in a special collection (for info: 920-424-4224 or music@uwosh.edu)"
