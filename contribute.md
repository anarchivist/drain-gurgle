The Radio Preservation Task Force and Association for Recorded Sound Collections are gathering collection-level information for this database. At this time, the project is actively seeking collections with sound recordings and other radio-related materials.

To submit collection(s) to be listed, please use [this online form](https://goo.gl/forms/KHWID21hzav1KiCx2){:target="_blank"}. Explanations of the form fields can be found in [our documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RLn2nFJfIWhF9gjhv3-Q_GeNx_zNnB1EthGhjCsgqxg/edit).

Please fill out the form separately for each discrete collection. If you have a large number of collections, please contact William Vanden Dries at [wvandend at indiana.edu](mailto:wvandend@indiana.edu) to discuss alternate ways to submit your information. Please also note that form submissions will not show up automatically in the database.
